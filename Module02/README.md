# Module 02 – Basic Programming Modules (Python)

This folder contains my assignment for **Module 02: Basic Programming Modules – Python**, where I practiced essential programming concepts using Python.  
The goal of this assignment was to explore core Python modules and understand how they support real-world AI development.

---

## 📌 Assignment Overview

This module included eight different Python programming exercises:

### 1. **File I/O Example**
Created and managed a text file by writing, appending, and reading data using Python’s `open()` function.  
Useful for logging, text processing, and managing user-generated data.

### 2. **Strings Example**
Manipulated strings by changing case, slicing text, replacing words, and checking text conditions.  
Important for NLP preprocessing and user-input handling.

### 3. **Async Example**
Used `asyncio` to run concurrent tasks with different delays.  
Helps in building efficient chatbots, servers, or real-time systems.

### 4. **HTTP Example**
Connected to the GitHub API using the `requests` library and extracted repository data.  
This demonstrates working with APIs, which is essential for integrating AI with external data sources.

### 5. **Database Example (SQLite)**
Created an in-memory SQLite database of students and queried top performers.  
Databases are critical for structured data storage in AI pipelines.

### 6. **NumPy Example**
Performed mathematical operations, matrix multiplication, and basic statistics.  
NumPy is fundamental for numerical computing in machine learning.

### 7. **Pandas Example**
Created and analyzed a DataFrame of chemical elements.  
Pandas is the primary tool for data preprocessing in AI workflows.
