# AI Applications Portfolio – ITAI 2277

**Student:** Ruben Valenzuela  
**Course:** ITAI 2277 – Artificial Intel Resource  
**Instructor:** Anna Devarakonda  

This repository contains my main assignments and project phases for the AI Applications Capstone course.  
The goal is to showcase my learning progress, technical skills, and ability to build AI solutions.

## Repository Structure

- [Module 01 – Reflective Journal](Module01/)
  - Reflective journal for **Introduction to AI**, connecting class slides with my own insights.


- [Module 02 – Basic Python Programming](Module02/)
  - Exercises covering file I/O, strings, async, HTTP requests, SQLite, NumPy, and Pandas


- [Phase 01 – Project Proposal](Phase01_Project_Proposal/)
  - Project proposal for the **AI Course Copilot – RAG-Powered Study & Project Assistant**.  
    This phase outlines the problem definition, target users, proposed solution, system goals,  
    and high-level architecture. It establishes the foundation for the entire capstone project.

- [Phase 02 – Data Pipeline & EDA](Phase02/)
  - Data pipeline design, preprocessing workflow, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis.  
    Includes data acquisition, cleaning steps, semantic chunking, embedding generation,  
    and descriptive statistics to understand patterns within the course documents.


- [Phase 03 – Working AI Model](Phase03_Working_Model/)
  - Development, evaluation, and optimization of the retrieval-augmented AI model for the **AI Course Copilot**.
    This phase includes architecture design, embedding configuration, chunking strategy, performance evaluation,
    error analysis, and iterative improvements over baseline methods.
    Key components include BM25 vs dense retrieval comparison, reranker experiments, and generation quality testing.

- [Phase 04 – Integrated System Prototype](Phase04_System_Prototype/)
  - End-to-end functional prototype for the **AI Course Copilot**, including sentence-transformer embeddings, FAISS index, retrieval pipeline, and a Gradio user interface for testing the assistant in real time.

- **[phase05_final_delivery/](Phase05_Final_Delivery/)**
  - Complete final project delivery for the **AI Course Copilot – RAG Prototype**, including:
    - **Google Colab notebook** containing:
      - Working RAG model  
      - Retrieval pipeline (FAISS)  
      - Embedding generation  
      - Re-ranking and answer generation  
      - Gradio user interface prototype  
      - Instructions for running the system  
    - **Technical Report (Phase 05)** summarizing:
      - System architecture  
      - Model evaluation  
      - Final performance insights  
      - Limitations and next steps  
    - **Final Presentation (POP AI)** showing:
      - Problem overview  
      - Methodology  
      - Results and demo  
      - Team contributions
